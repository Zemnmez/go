/*
Package tree implements functionality for rendering a tree
of stateful, encapsulated components Ã¥ la React.

This package is a low-level API that describes the internal workings
of the implementation. For the consumer API, see zemn.me/term/react.



Theory

For a react-like component, we need components that describe
their tree of dependencies for data, and are able to tell the
library when they're changed.

Building a system like this in Go has its pros and cons.

First, Javascript has the benefit of first-class data serialization objects --
in Javascript it's easier to say 'the component has some data'
and operate on changes in that data.

Second, React's JSX makes it much harder to do things that make it difficult
to operate in a reactive fashion properly. It's vital that components have
known keys, or 'slots', so we can map each component's state to its previous
state. This is something that's very difficult, if not impossible to enforce
in vanilla Go.

However, because it's much easier and faster to compare structures in Go,
it's much less necessary to have good ShouldUpdate comparisons, and
we totally avoid any need for anything like immutable.js by just not using
pointers.




Practice

We start with a root Render function which constructs a tree of Components.
This tree is passed to whatever package ultimately maps component data
to some representation, like an HTML element or an area in a console.

When a component mounts i.e. we pass it to the final representation mapper
we call Component.Mount(StateController), where StateController has an
Update() function to tell our tree that the tree has updated at this point.

Then, we can perform another Component.Render() to get new child components,
and ask those children whether they will change as a result of their new
construction by passing the old children the new state.

If a child agrees that they should re-render, we call the Update() function
of the new child, as though the child itself updated. This continues
down the tree until it reaches a node with no children.

Because we need the children to be ordered the same way for mapping old to new
state, we panic if a Component.Render() produces a different number of children.

If a Component.Render() would cause a child to be removed, it instead returns
a nil Component. When a nil Component is returned, the Component.Close() function
of the Component that used to be in that slot is called to allow it to clean
itself up.
